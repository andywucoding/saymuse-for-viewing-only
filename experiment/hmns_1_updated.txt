Known as ecosystem engineers, oysters build thie s in areas where many other species live resulting in high biodiversity. Ecosystem services include: • Water filtration • Food and habitat • Shoreline stabilization and protection • Fisheries The oyster reefs within the Gulf of Mexico are some of the healthiest in the world. The Eastern oyster ranges from Canada to Texas. Oysters grow best in lower salinity, brackish waters; they can grow in higher salinity, but have trouble with disease, parasites, and predators. Oysters are a favorite seafood item for many people. Galveston Bay is the most important area for oyster harvest in Texas. Salinity The salinity of water refers to how much salt is in it. Water with low salinity has very little salt. Water with high salinitiy has a lot of salt. Hypersalinity refers to coastal or ocean with waters higher than normal ocean salinity. Waters that are a mixture of fresh water and salt are referred to as brackish.

UPPER COAST The upper Texas coast is characterized by a large human population centered around Galveston Bay, Galveston Island, the Bolivar Peninsula, and the mainland reaching the coast to the east and west of Galveston. The major natural passes from the bay into the Gulf include Bolivar Pass, which serves as the entrance to the Houston Ship Channel, on the east end of Galveston Island, and San Luis Pass on the west end. The six counties reaching the coast include Orange, Jefferson, Chambers, Harris, Galveston, and Brazoria. There are two main estuaries in this region: Galveston Bay and Sabine Lake, which is situated on the Texas-Louisiana border. There are considerable coastal protected lands along the upper coast, and ecologically the area is characterized by high rainfall and freshwater inflow, which provides good habitat for extensive salt marshes and oyster reefs.

Salt Marshes Salt marshes are the most common shoreline habitat on the upper Texas coast. Ecosystem services include: • Important nursery ground for shrimp, crabs, and fish • Protection and stabilization of shorelines • Water fibration of run-off from the land The habitat is dominated by salt marsh cordgrass, but includes many other salt tolerant plants. These marshes are primarily found in environments with quiet water, llow energy environments and gently Stoping shorelmes. Salt marshes are split into three regions: the outer/lower marsh, the middle marsh, and the high marsh. Salt marshes are a type of coastal wetland dominated by salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). This habitat is common on the bay shorelines of the upper Texas coast, where the water has a lower salinity. Moving down the coast, salt marshes become less frequent until disappearing entirely in the Corpus Christi region. Here, they are replaced by wind tidal flats as the salt content in the water becomes higher. Because salt marshes tend to exist in calm water, with little in the way of waves or currents, they are oiten found near river deltas and upper bay areas along the coast. Fine, sott sediments and muds make up the surface of the salt marsh habitat, and the shoreline tends to be low and gently sloping. Although salt marsh cordgrass is the dominant species of the outer or lower marsh, many other plant species occur landward of it. In the middle marsh, common species include saltwort, glasswort, sea purslane, and shore grass. In the high marsh, common spadies include sea ox-eye daisy, camphor daisy, saltgrass, seashore dropssed, sea blite, Carolina wolfberry, and sea lavender.

the coastline, mediately interior from coastal massi.ons of the most pervasive species of plants dominating grasslands closer to the coast is Saltmeadow Cordgrass (Spartina patens). These thick bushels of grass punctuate the landscape in thick clusters, often at high densities. M igratory geese have diminished annually in recent years since coastal prairie rice crops are being replaced with corn, grown for ethanol, which does not lure the geese in to feed. On a positive note, Mountain Lions (Felis concolor) are returning to east Texas, with records just west of Houston on the Katy Prairie. The Coastal Prairie is home to a plethora of Threatened and Endangered species. This is initially surprising because of the flat and homogenous nature of prairie grassland, largely void of stands of forest or woodland. Perhaps for this very reason the prairie is in demand for agrarian purposes; it is much easier to convert to grazing pastures or cropland than forest.

Some of these, like terns and the Black Skimmer, prefer areas with low elevation and vegetation, where they hollow out a small depression in the sand to lay their eggs. These are called ground nesters, and their eggs are always well-camouflaged to blend in with their surroundings. Other birds, such as the heron and egrets, are considered shrub nesters. They build their nests in low vegetation, brush, or even trees to keep their chicks away from predators. The nests are made of twigs, sticks, and grass from the surrounding island area. Protecting the colonial waterbirds and their nesting sites is an incredibly important conservation effort. The National Audubon Society gained national recognition in the early 1900s by raising awareness of the shooting of many colonial waterbirds for their feathers in the millinery trade. Today, Audubon remains instrumental

to the protection of birds across the U.S., and Audubon Texas is important specifically for their work in protecting the colonial nesting sites along the Texas coast. The annual Texas Colonial Waterbird Survey monitors waterbird abundance along the entire Texas coast each year. This monumental effort involves a large number of volunteers who attempt to count all of the colonial waterbirds and their nests. This information is used to better understand the status and population trends of each species as it changes over time. The Texas Colonial Waterbird Society is an important coalition working to monitor, promote research, and inform the management of colonial waterbird populations in Texas. The partnership includes a number of state and federal agencies, as well as universities and individuals who care about this treasured resource all along the Texas coast.

What is an Estuary? Estuaries exist all along the Texas coast. These partially enclosed areas of water are fed by freshwater rivers and streams, as well as ocean water. This mixture of fresh and salt water is what form an estuary.

Brown Pelican-A Conservation & Restc (From Audubon Texas website) Through the early 1900s, shooting for the millinery trade and to "protect" fishing caused a major decline in the Brown Pelican population. Legal protection began in 1903 when Pelican Island, Florida was set aside as a federal preserve. Despite this, and despite the birds' longevity and popularity, Brown Pelicans nearly disappeared from North America between the 1950s and the 1970s as a result of pesticide use. The pesticide endrin killed pelicans outright, and DDT caused thin-shelled eggs that broke under the weight of incubating parents. By 1970 all North American populations, with the exception of a few in Florida, were gone, and the species was placed on the Federal Endangered Species List.

MIDDLE COAST The middle Texas coast is characterized by the low human population and large areas of private lands, many of which support ranching and farming. There are three major estuaries or bay systems along this part of the coast: Matagorda Bay, San Antonio Bay, and Copano Bay. In addition, there is one large federal protected area for whooping cranes known as the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. The six counties reaching the coast here are Matagorda, Jackson, Victoria, Calhoun, Refugio, and Aransas. The outer coast is bordered by Matagorda Peninsula, Matagorda Island, and San Jose Island. Pass Cavallo leads into Matagorda Bay and the ephemeral Cedar Bayou between Matagorda Island and San Jose Island. Ecologically, rainfall and freshwater inflow are lower than the upper coast. As a result, salt marshes and oyster reefs do exist, although they are not as widespread as on the upper coast.
