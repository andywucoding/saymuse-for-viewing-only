    "Covering most of the northern third of the African continent, it takes a songbird 35 to 40 hours to fly across this vast desert, and many birds cross this desert at night to avoid the strong heat. There are many other perils for birds to avoid during migration: avoiding traps or predators such as house cats, avoiding hitting a tower or window, avoiding environmental extremes such as drought, or destroyed habitat at their destination.\n",
    "Maintaining energy\n",
    "reserves is very important to migrating birds - if a bird runs out of fuel it will often perish. During migration many species will stop to 'refuel' by eating or drinking, even in some of the most unlikely environments, such as the Saharan desert.\n",

    "Mollusks that do not lay eggs release vast amounts of eggs or sperm which, when joined together, produce free-swimming veligers that can travel many miles to new habitats.\n",
    "Some female egg-laying mollusks form groups or \"aggregations\" to lay their eggs in large masses, which helps keep predators from destroying all the young from a single female's eggs. These egg cases are occasionally seen by beachcombers as they wash ashore after most eggs have hatched their young.\n",
