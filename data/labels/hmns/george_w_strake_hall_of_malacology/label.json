Streams, rivers, ponds and lakes provide these filter-feeding mollusks with the nutrients necessary for survival. However, many species are now extinct or under extreme pressure to survive due to pollution and habitat loss. Around the world these mollusks are under great pressure to coexist with humans' increasing need for land and freshwater. As a result, some species of clams are also threatened with extinction because the juvenile must spend part of its early lifecycle in the gills of certain species of freshwater fishes. Protection of habitats is necessary and in many instances is proving effective. In Texas the Tampico pearlymussel, (Cyrtomaids tampicoensis) found in the Concho River, can produce a freshwater pearl that rivals and exceeds the beauty and value of rare South Sea pearls. Some of these pearls can be found in the exhibit case on pearls. FRESHWATER GASTROPODS Though far less numerous and well known, freshwater gastropod mollusks are found around the world in streams, rivers, ponds, lakes and swamps. Their shapes are variable as in their marine cousins, but they lack their bright colors in order to remain hidden from predators. Many can carry diseases that are harmful or even deadly to humans such as the Planorbidae snails, which can be carriers of schistosomiasis. So, unlike marine gastropods, very few are consumed by humans. Participate in local area beach clean-up events.

From giant kelp forests and turtle and eel grasses to algae-covered sea floors, these mollusks help keep the balance of nature in check. Still others feed on sponges, gorgonians and even corals. Many deep water Cyprea can be seen feeding on sponges by R.O.V. (remotely-operated vehicles). The nutrient-rich sea floor also supports many mollusks that help keep the environment clean.

Once a shell has had the encrusting forms of sea life removed we see the beauty beneath. Such forms of sea life provide the protection of camouflage from predators. PEARLS - Of the few organic, naturally formed gems, natural pearls are the rarest and highly valued, especially those used in jewelry. Cultured pearls are more commonly found but also highly prized for their beauty and less costly availability. All pearls come.from some form of mollusk. Bivalves, such as pearl oysters, produce the well-known South Sea pearls. Any mollusk is capable of producing a pearl if a foreign body is introduced into the living tissue of the mollusk. The resulting irritation causes the animal to cover the irritant with layer after layer of the calcium carbonate material that it uses to cover the interior of its shell. Examples of these pearls are shown with their host shell. PEARLIZED AND NORMAL SHELLS Commonly used as decorative objects, shells that have had the outer layers of calcium carbonate removed now appear as pearlized shells. By using hydrochloric acid to remove the colorful outer layers of shell material, the lovely pearly interior layers are revealed. Pearl buttons are made using this method. Shown here are pairs of shells in the natural and pearlized states to show their inner beauty.
