When they needed a way of separating substances by particle size, they turned to filters. By running substances through different kinds of filter media, they could catch particles above a certain size. BALANCE SCALE When alchemists really got serious, they needed a way to make quantitative analysis of their experiments, keeping track of how much their reagents weighed before going into reactions and comparing that weight With reaction Proaucts Luckily, the balance scale had been around for quite some time in the evaluation of currency. FLAME LEST APPARATUS Early experimentalists discovered that when metals burn, they emit different colors of light. The so-called flame test allowed alchemists to figure out which elements were handful of metals were known, they could be easily identified by the color of their flames. For example, copper salts burn green, while sodium burns yellow. MORTAR AND PESTLE A bowl-like mortar paired with a pestle for pounding-both made r\u00f3m hard materials such as granite\u2014 were used to grind up solid reagents. Crushing chunks of material into line powuer greatly increased the surface area available for interesting reactions. COPPER STILL Some alchemists designed a distilling apparatus made of copper or ronze, fashioned so that, as the bottom vessel was gently heated, the top could be cooled with water or ice. This allowed alchemists to distill substances more efficiently using gentler heat. CRUCIBLE Crucibles are small metal or ceramic vessels made for withstanding the high heat, rapid temperature changes, and caustic reactions occurring inside furnaces. By heating the ore within them to molten-hot temperatures, alchemists could separate metal from slag. Then, using specialized crucibles made of bone ash called cupels, alchemists could separate base metals (which reacted with the cupel) from heavy, noble metals like gold, silver, and platinum. FURNACE Every alchemist's workshop requires a way to heat up materials. Heating substances can change their physical state, increase the speed of reactions, and provide the initial spark of energy that gets a reaction going in the first place. Refractory furnaces used bellows to inject oxygen in order to achieve the high temperatures needed to smelt metals, while chambered furnaces could drive off oxygen and heat up reagents in its absence. Sand or oil baths atop these furnaces could be used to heat delicate mixtures evenly. ALEMBIC Separating mixed substances from one another was one great challenge facing alchemists. They figured out that some substances have different boiling points than others. An alembic is an assembly of glassware designed to make use of this difference in volatility to distill substances. After heating the base, the more volatile substance vaporizes hirst and condenses in the cooler neck, eventually \u2022 collecting in the second vessel. ALCHEMICAL INVENTIONS Alchemists might not have understood the chemistry behind their experiments, but the tools they invented in their quests for riches and eternal life actually worked. These inventions-from glass-blown distillation vessels to specialized furnaces-allowed them to handle the elements with new precision and paved the way for chemistry.",

Except for hydrogen -which has no neutrons-protons and neutrons form the nucleus of every atom, while electrons orbit the nucleus in a series of successive energy levels called shells. In atomic models, these shells are often represented by concentric circles, but in reality, they are cloudlike zones in which an electron can exist anywhere at any moment. When an Imbalance of protons and electrons produces an unstable electric charge, atoms stabilize themselves by stealing or sharing electrons in their outer shells. This exchange forms chemical bonds-the basis for all chemical interactivity.",
