There are many other perils for birds to avoid during migration: avoiding traps or predators such as house cats, avoiding hitting a tower or window, avoiding environmental extremes such as drought, or destroyed habitat at their destination. Maintaining energy reserves is very important to migrating birds - if a bird runs out of fuel it will often perish. During migration many species will stop to 'refuel' by eating or drinking, even in some of the most unlikely environments, such as the Saharan desert.

There are actually two species in Africa, those from the Savannah (Loxodonta africana) that you see in this diorama, and a smaller species that lives in forest, aptly called the Forest Elephant (L. cyclotis). Additionally Asia harbors several subspecies of Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus), including the Pygmy Elephant endemic to Borneo. These living species are the last of a lineage of much more hairy relatives that walked the planet during the Pleistocene, known as Mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) and Mastodons (Mammut americanum). Elephants are vital landscape architects in the tropical regions they inhabit. They are important for seed dispersal, carrying seeds to spawn and grow away from the parent plant. Moreover, they are important at molding landscapes, removing plants that would otherwise monopolize a habitat, providing a variety of refugia for smaller animals by toppling trees onto their sides, and other important roles. Indeed, in areas where elephant populations have exceeded the number that can be comfortably supported at a given site, the landscape becomes quite denuded. Unfortunately elephants are tied to the one thing that is as coveted by some cultures as gold or diamonds\u2014ivory. The demand for the illegal trade in ivory has pushed elephants to the brink of extinction in many areas. In some regions of Africa, tuskless elephants have been evolutionarily favored over their tusked brethren. If elephants don't have tusks they are of little value to poachers and thus not hunted, which means tuskless genes are carried forth to future generations.",

            "label_str": "SPECIATION AND DESCRIBING NEW SPECIES ew species evolve via a number of different modes, the most ommon of which involves isolation. Oceanic islands are perhaps he first and most extreme form of isolation, but such 'islands' an also form on mainlands. Imagine a mountaintop where the pecies inhabiting the very top is unable to exist at lower elevations. That's an island barrier. Other examples include species cratered in valleys between mountains or rivers, or other barriers created by contrasting habitats. Over evolutionary millennia, those species with a common ancestor undergo separate trajectories with their own unique set of adaptations, such that ultimately they are very different. Distinguishing and describing these new forms is the job of a museum zoologist, such as HMNS' Curator of Vertebrate Zoology, Dr. Dan Brooks. On occasion one stumbles upon a new species while examining museum specimens or running DNA analyses and noticing something distinct. These tandem situations led to the description of four new species of African House Bats: Livingstone's (Scotophilus livingstonii) of tropical central Africa, Andrew Rebori's (S. andrewreborii) and Trujillo's (S. trujilloi) of Kenya, and Ejetai's (S. ejetai) from Ethiopia. Firming this up with morphological and DNA analyses led to the description of these four new species in 2014 by Dr. Brooks and his colleague, Dr. John Bickham. You can see displayed the new taxon Andrew Rebori's House Bat (S. andrewreborii), which was thought to be African Yellow House Bat (S. dinganii) until DNA and morphological analysis proved otherwise. Brooks named the new form Scotophilus andrewreborii in honor of Andrew Rebori, longtime friend and family member of HMNS Collections staff. In the Etymology section of the monograph describing the new species, Brooks wrote: It is our honor to name this species for Andrew N. Rebori (1948-2011). Rebori unknowingly touched the lives and inspired many individuals, including many museum professionals. He always maintained a keen interest in animals... While describing new species may seem glamorous, it is incredibly grueling, painstaking work. Dealing with international permits for collecting, organizing personnel and logistics, making the long trip and returning in one piece, preparing the specimens, finely examining a plethora of study skins and analyzing specimens under a powerful microscope is hardly work to be envied. More often than not, results in fatigue and a really good night's sleep. Imagine looking at 10 or 20 different measurements of 50 or more bat skulls-with an entire skull being the size of your fingernail, and half of those measurements being of the surfaces of different types of teeth. It's enough to cause splitting headaches and often does.",
