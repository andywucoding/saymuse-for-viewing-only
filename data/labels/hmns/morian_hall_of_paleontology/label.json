Long-necks, formally known as sauropods, grew larger and larger until they reached 30 tons or more\u2014 as heavy as five normal-sized elephants. No clan of land animals ever matched the bulk of the Long-necks. What was their secret? Sauropod necks were hollow and filled with air, like bird necks, so the beasts could swing the neck side-to-side quickly. To reach high in the tree-tops, long-necks went tripodal. Hind legs were much stronger than the fore legs, and the tail served as a third limb for balancing when the body tilted up. Diplodocus was the ultimate tripod. Its tail was immensely strong, and its torso was lightened by hollowed-out vertebrae. When tipped up, the head could reach 25 feet. Close cousin Barosaurus could reach 36 feet. With heads that high, the heart couldn't pump blood to the brain. No problem. The brain was tiny and could function without fresh blood for 10 minutes at a time. Long-necks didn't chew. Instead, they plucked branches off trees and passed the food down to their muscular gizzards, where hard rocks crushed and split the vegetable bits. Fossilized gizzard stones have been dug inside the ribcages of long-necks and their kin. For defense, Diplodocus had a giant bull whip. The last 30 feet of the tail were made from thin bone rods jointed together and encased in tough connective tissue. The powerful muscles at the front of the tail could swing the whip-end with tremendous speed. A direct hit on a meat-eater's face would cause dreadful pain.

The earliest members of the tyrannosaur family were smaller; the species called Gorgosaurus ruled the Judithian Age, growing to 2 tons \u201410 times heavier than a big male lion, but less than half the size of a T. rex. Go gosaurus had the distinctive hands of the tyrannosaur ramily. Instead of the three-fingered hands of allosaurs ar acrocanthosaurs, gorgosaurs had hands with two small, weak fingers. The shoulder blade and upper arm were much thinner and less muscular than those of earlier carnivores. Why did Tyrannosaurs evolve such weak arms and hands? Professor Henry Fairfield Osborn, who named Tyrannosaurus and the tyrannosaur family in 1905, had an answer: Tyrannosaurs were ticklers! Osborn knew that big, scary apex predators might need a way to express soft, family-friendly emotions. A tyrannosaur male might reach out to a female and delicately massage her shoulders. Or a mother tyrannosaur might stroke he when trey helped in raising the tyrannosauce Swift Ankles, Speedy Shine The best way to compare speed in meat-eating dinosaurs is by comparing ankles and spins. Faster speed requires longer legs below the knee. Compare Gorgosaurus to the Early Cretaceous Acrocanthosaurus. The gorgosaur clearly has an advantage in limb proportions, and thus could outrun the earlier Cretaceous predator. Why did big meat-eaters get faster? Was there a co-evolutionary arms race between predator and prey? Were herbivorous dinosaurs getting faster in the Late Cretaceous? No\u2014 the common plant-eaters of the Late Cretaceous, the duck-bills, were about as fast as their Early-Cretaceous relatives, the iguanodonts. This is yet another dinosaur puzzle.

Large molars were capable of crunching young grass, roots, and berries. Killer fangs could dispatch a buffalo with one bite.

Western Australia's Strelley Pool Formation is one of the best-known locations for uncovering stromatolite fossils. Although it is hot and arid now, paleontologists and geologists believe that the Strelley Pool was once the floor of a shallow ocean, where stromatolite-forming microbes would have thrived. There, seawater would have kept the mounds moist while sunlight could still penetrate deep enough to allow photosynthesis. Because oxygen was so scarce at the time the Strelley Pool stromatolites were formed, some paleontologists believe microbes based their metabolism on sulfur, instead. One by-product of sulfur-based metabolism is the mineral pyrite, also known as fool's gold. Mixed among the dark sandstone and fossil microbes in the Strelley Pool are crystals of fool's gold, supporting the theory that early microbes based their metabolism on sulfur. Did you know?

About 2.2 billion years ago, a type of sediment called Banded Iron Formations, or BIFs, became common. BIFs have layers of iron-poor sediment alternating with iron-rich layers. Something was generating oxygen, but what was it? The most likely answer is blue green microbes called cyanobacteria. Although small and simple, cyanobacteria evolved the chemical equipment to perform photosynthesis. Photosynthesis generates oxygen, so when cyanobacteria multiplied, they could have generated enough oxygen to change the Earth's water and air chemistry. This ancient blue green bacteria was the single-most important step in making the air and water right for the evolution of higher life forms.",

Soft body parts are rarely fossilized, so the vast majority of life in the Cambrian sea was virtually unknown until 1909, when paleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott discovered the fossils of the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada. In the shale was an array of fossilized soft body forms, and Walcott discovered strange examples of nearly every phylum that exists today.

Two great subcontinents existed Laurasia, made up of present day North America and Eurasia, and Gondwanaland, composed of present-day South America, Africa, India, Australia and Antarctica. On a fine vacation in the Carboniferous or in the Permian, you could walk from Houston to Rio de Janeiro, then over to Nairobi, farther east to New Delhi, and on down to Sydney. But how are scientists able to piece together how continents came together and fell apart? With the help of our little friends, the trilobites. In the early 1800s, fossil hunters uncovered a trilobite mystery. A genus of large trilobites called Paradoxides had a strange distribution: Specimens were found across Massachusetts, Georgia, Wales, and Morocco, but none in Ohio, Nevada, Russia or China. It didn't make sense. Like crabs and lobsters today, trilobites probably avoided deep water and would have spread by hugging the coasts. So how could Paradoxides go from Boston to Morocco but not traverse the shallow seas covering the American Midwest or Eastern Europe? It wasn't until the 1960s that geologists discovered that our continents had sailed around the globe, crashing into each other to make super-continents and then ripping back apart. Shallow-water creatures like Paradoxides helped scientists map out ancient continents that vanished long ago. Paradoxides had lived along the coast of an ancient continent, Avalonia, that was smashed between North America, Africa and Europe during the creation of Pangea.

Tabulate and rough-horn corals helped build the reefs, assisted by stromatoporoid sponges. Trilobites lived in the reefs as cephalopods swam above, and brachiopods attached themselves to the reef and to the bottom mud. Devonian reefs were so large and widespread that they controlled ocean currents in many shallow water habitats. Today, oil-geologists search for buried reefs with exploratory drilling, and their remains continue to pour out millions of barrels of fossil fuel. How did these reefs die? Tabulate and horn corals suffered a deep fall in diversity, as did the stromatoporoids sponges. Trilobite Catastrophe In the Late Devonian, trilobites suffered the greatest die off in their history. Since the Cambrian, the trilobite family tree had developed a dozen main orders (major evolutionary units containing a multitude of families), each one with a distinctive style of eyes, spines, bodies and tails. Despite some Ordovician extinctions, Devonian trilobites were rich in variety. But the End-Devonian Extinction cut down every single trilobite order except one. Brachiopods suffered extinction at the same time, and so did cephalopods. Apex-Predators-Panzer-Sharks Gone! The End-Devonian crisis came in waves spaced out over about 10 million years. The first blows came against the reefs and the invertebrates. Then, late in the period, the biggest, most advanced predators died out completely. Panzer-sharks like Dunkleosteus achieved their greatest size and ferocity and then disappeared. All the armor-plated placoderm fish died out.

Glaciers were appearing in Gondwanaland, and the southern ice age was getting more severe. Perhaps cool ocean water killed some ocean systems. Pollution From the Land? Woodlands evolved rapidly at the end of the period, and rivers and streams became clogged with vegetable debris during the rainy season. Plant roots also helped break down rocks and change hard minerals into soft clays. In heavy rains, runoff carried tons of mud and silt into the watercourses and could have suffocated the reefs with organic detritus.",

Fish-like creatures had evolved much earlier-back in the Cambrian and Ordovician\u2014 but most were small and none were strong swimmers. As the Silurian ended and the Devonian began, fish evolution erupted into dozens of new and dynamic forms. The coelacanths are muscular relatives of the lungfish, and were the inspiration for the classic horror film Creature from the Black Lagoon. Coelacanths became diverse and common throughout freshwater and saltwater environments in the Devonian and afterwards. They thrived during the days of the dinosaurs in the Triassic, Jurassic and Crelaceous Periods and two species still survive today virtually unchanged - Latimeria chalumnae and Latimeria menadoensis. When the first coelacanth fossils were named and described in the mid 1800s, these ancient fish were assumed to have gone extinct at the end of the Cretaceous. In 1938, the coelacanths were re discovered when a living specimen was discovered in a fisherman's catch in South Africa. A second species was identified in 1999. Coelacanths are considered to be living fossils, having evolved to their present form approximately 400 million years ago. Along with their relatives, the lungfish, and the tetrapods, coelacanths are lobe-finned fish, the first fish to emerge on land. Lobe-finned fish are characterized by their paired fins, which are joined to the body by a single bone. The pectoral and pelvic fins of lobe-finned fish would evolve into the legs of the first amphibians. The main lines of bony fish also appeared early in the Devonian: Cheirolepis represented the line of ray-finned fish that would evolve into trout and salmon, tuna and mackerel, and most of the rest of today's fish.",

Fish eat parts of leaves, branches, bark and stems, along with a variety of bugs that feed on the plants. For the first 300 million years of the Paleozoic, there was little plant life on land. And as long as there were no forests on land, ecosystems in lakes and rivers were poor. The first land plants evolved in the Silurian Period, about 420 million years ago. By the Mid-Devonian, 390 million years ago, the first trees with woody trunks appeared, Then evolution sped up. Dense forests of woody troes spread in the late Devonian. When abundant food arrived on the land, opportunities opened to new species that evolved the organs needed to survive out of water. Air could dry up delicate gills, but some gill-breathers successfully made the transition. One group of sea scorpions modified their book gills to become book lungs and became land scorpions. Then come the carliest insects. Meanwhile, several clans of fish had evolved lungs. The evolution of amphibians- the earliest vertebrates with legs-occurred in the Devonian. The lobe-finned fish Eusthenopteron had lungs and powerful fin bones equipped with well-formed joints at shoulder, hip, elbow and knee. Complicated leg muscles let Eusthenopteron walk across shallow pond botfoms and push through areas with dense water plants. Acanthostega evolved from a Eusthenopteron-like ancestor. It retained gills, but its legs were even stronger. Instead of finny feet, Acanthostego had genuine toes shaped much like today's frog toes. Acanthostega and its relatives were amphibians--creatures who were born in the water but could move over land as adults. Amphibian necks were evolving, too, Lobe-finned fish had no real neck-the head was aftached directly to the forso.

However, the plant species in the Carboniferous didn't match what we see in today's bogs. Today, flowering plants are the dominant clan, even in swampy, boggy sites. Grass, most bushes, trees, and all the flowers belong to the flowering-plant group. But not a single fossil from a flowering plant could be found in the Carboniferous. Instead of trees with flowers, Carboniferous habitats were full of giant, tree-size relatives of today's ground pine and horsetail reeds - primitive plants that do not produce any sort of flower. Another strange plant group in the Carboniferous were the seed ferns. Seed ferns grew into tall trees that carried big leaves shaped like fern fronds. True ferns never produce seeds, but use tiny spores for reproduction The Carboniferous seed ferns did something never seen today: they combined fern-like foliage with complex seeds. Fossil animals tell a similar story. Carboniferous coal beds preserved many forms of arthropods with jointed legs. Spiders, millipedes, centipedes and scorpions were abundant, and some were huge in size. Late Carboniferous dragonflies had wingspans almost a yard across, and some spiders were as large as wolves.

Fossil Ballistics-Prehistoric CSI We use fossil footh crowns as paleontological bullets to tell us who attacked whom. Dimetrodon and other amphibians and reptiles grew new tooth crowns all their lives. Old teeth were forced out by new teeth growing up, and once the root of the old tooth dissolved, the crown fell out. HMNS' Paleontology Team has discovered hundreds of Redbeds bullets, and these can help us discover what Dimetrodon ate. One big surprise. Dimetrodon ate xenacanths, the venomous spined swamp sharks. Xenacanths were unusual sharks. They didn't have a normal shark tail. Instead, they had a long, pointed triangular tail, a shape we see today in fish that swim forward and backward through swamp vegetation. Xenacanth teeth had tiny double-fangs. The real defense was the long saw edged spine attached to a swivel at the back of the head. The swivel spine had a long groove running up from the base-evidence that there was a poison gland. Many of today's sharks have poison spines on their dorsal fins. A big xenacanth shark would be a dangerous target for any meat-eater, but ballistic evidence shows that Dimetrodon attacked these formidable fish regularly.

Like many saber-toothed animals, Uintatherium evolved a special chin-guard that protects the fangs when its mouth is closed To allow the animal to stab and slice with its sabers, the jaw joint lets the mouth open exceptionally wide. And, to increase the deadliness of the bite, the neck muscles are arranged to pull the head down, driving the fang further into the target. The most famous saber-tooth is the Ice Age cat, Smilodon (you will see some up ahead). Most saber-toothed cats were of modest size, no bigger than a lion or tiger. The most gigantic of all saber-toothed animals were the uintatheres, common in mid-Eocene days. Skulls reached a yard in length. Bodies were elephant-heavy -8 tons or more. The uintathere could hone its giant upper fang by sliding it over a small lower tooth - an action that kept the fang edge sharp. No mammal in the Eocene was nearly as dangerous.

Instead, they would whack at the carcass with their blunt premolars and molars, smashing the body into a White River haggis. The Killer Warthog's speed made it even more frightening. The legs were very long. There were only two compact hooves on each foot, a design for high velocity chases over hard terrain. Few herbivores could outrun an Archaeotherium.

While modern warthogs have warts of soft skin and fat, prehistoric warts were bony, biggest in males, and made for frightening each other and impressing females.

Beginning around 35 million years ago in the Late Eocene, streams flowng down from the Rocky Mountains brought sand and silt eastward onto the flatlands.

In the rainy season, the mushy mix of ash and mud did a super job of burying skeletons that lay on the surface or hid in burrows. For 10 million years, on through the Oligocene, the layers were built up. Eventually, the entire White River Group covered much of what are now six states. The climate got drier and drier, and the volcanic ash made the soil so alkaline that only the hardiest grasses and sagebrush could grow. Fast-forward to modern times. Streams had eroded many valleys, exposing White River layers. Summers were now exceptionally hot and dry, while winters were very cold. The first Europeans to explore the White River region were French fur-trappers in the 1700s. They feared the blistering heat and the undrinkable water, full of eroded volcanic ash. They called the dreist of the White River valleys the Mauvaise Terre-The Badlands.

The Silica dissolved in the water and the buried wood soaked up the silica-rich solution like a sponge. The dissolved silica fills the spaces in the lacey network of cells that make up the wood. Over time the water evaporates and leaves behind the silica, which solidifies. Within spaces such as a crack or a rotten spot in the wood, the silica may form large quartz crystals with visible natural facets. In most of the wood, the rapidly solidifying silica forms milky opal, or layer upon layer of colorful agate.

It crossed the Bering Land Bridge and moved into the woodlands and prairies of Asia, Europe, India and Africa. Hipparion swept over the Old World like an equine Mongol horde. The earliest human-like creatures, the australopiths, were surrounded by Hipparion species 7 million years ago in tropical Africa. What gave Hipparion its momentum? Its feet were 90 percent modern. Most of the thrust came from the enlarged central hoof. Side toes still existed, but they were small and irregular. Jaws and teeth, too, were advanced. The six molars were tall and ever-growing. For most of its life, Hipparion had molars that grew up as fast as they wore down. This feet/molar combination opened up new, drier habitats, where leaves and branches were tougher and gritty dust covered the greenery. And the entire world was going that way. Summers were less moist. Tropical forests gave way to dry woodlands. Grasses took over ever greater areas of meadows. Hipparion was born to thrive in these new environments.",

Also as the Latin name implies, these mega-vultures eat carrion (decomposing flesh), fulfilling an extremely vital role as nature's solution to animals that die on our planet. While fossils of Andean Condors have been found in parts of Brazil that are now tropical, their relatives the California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus) have fossilized remains in North America, as do other species of closely related condors that are now extinct. It is likely that the massive Pleistocene mammals on display below the condors, such as giant ground sloths (Eremotherium) and giant armadillos (Glyptodon), crossed the paths of these 'rulers of the sky' during the Great American Faunal Interchange.

But in fact, the camel family is Made In The USA-it is a strictly North American product. The first camels show up in the fossil record around 35 million years ago in Nebraska and Wyoming. These camels were tiny and delicate and looked like a cross between a jackrabbit and a miniature gazelle. Their feet did not end in the wide, spreading toe-pads of modern camels. Instead, each toe had a sharp, compact hoof. The diet of early camels focused on low-growing herbs and bushes, with the addition of arid-land weeds and grass later on. Over the next 30 million years, camels evolved to include tiny, small, medium, large, and extra-large species-the tallest almost rivaling giraftes. Fangs and Noxious Loogies-Camel Defenses Camels co-evolved with saber-toothed cats, wolf-like hyenodonts and bears of all sorts, and camel self-defense developed along unusual lines. Instead of running away, like deer, camels fought back. They grew sharp fangs in their snouts, and they became expert marksmen with smelly spit. Saliva mixed with regurgitated stomach fluid could be hurled a dozen feet. Today, domesticated mid-sized camels \u2014the llama - make excellent guards for sheep. Lamas will charge a coyote, biting at its face and rump and unleashing salvos of noxious loogies. Our Paleolama was one of the middleweight species common across North America during the last 12 million years. In the Great Ice Age, camels got their chance to emigrate. The big camels crossed Beringia on their cushiony-feet, ready for the squishy sands and bare gravels of deserts in Asia, Arabia, and Africa. Mid-sized camels, llamas and vicu\u00f1as, went the other way into South America, down to the dry plains of Argentina and the mountain meadows of Peru:",

Hitting a mammoth at close range with a spear would have only made the mammoth mad. To kill mega-fauna, human hunters needed to double the velocity. Solution: The atlatl. This spear-thrower doubles the effective length of the hunter's arm. The spear shaft is laid along a stiff, narrow board about as long as the distance from fingers to elbow. A spike at the free end of the atlatl holds the buttend of the spear. The hunter hurls the atlatl forward with a quick flick of the wrist and elbow as the entire arm and shoulder goes forward. If executed correctly, the spear comes out of the atlatl with stunning energy. The shaft is a two-stage missile: The long main shaft receives the thrust from the atlatl. The shorter fore-shaft carries the point and is made from harder, denser wood. It separates from the main shaft just after the target is struck. Native hunters still use atlatls in parts of Australia to bring down kangaroos. Atlatls with heavy, harpoon-style fore-shafts are used to hunt whales and walrus in the North Pacific. When the Spanish Conquistadors invaded Mexico they were met by Aztec warriors with atlatis, which, properly thrown, dented steel armor. For prehistoric hunters, the atlatl changed the rules. Now humans were potential big-game killers. Mammoths, mastodons of all clans, rhinos, giant buffalo-none were safe. When did our species acquire this weaponry? Beautifully crafted atlatls made from antler or ivory come from French cave sites up to 18,000 years old. Archaeologists have long suspected that this weapon dates back much farther. Unfortunately, most atlatis were made of wood, and since woody material rots quickly, there is little hope of finding many ancient atlatls. Atlatl-Elbow & Mungo Man How can we tell when was the first atlatls were used? The best evidence comes from a case of atlatl-elbow. The oldest human remains from Australia include Mungo Man, buried 40,000-50,000 years ago near Mungo Lake. No atlatl was found here, but there is still spectacular proof of atlatling. Mungo Man had a peculiar injury to his right elbow\u2014a deterioration seen today in tennis players who have a powerful overhand serve. It's exceedingly unlikely that Mungo Man played tennis. However, there's another pastime that harms elbow joints in the same fashion: atlatling. Mungo seems to have atlatled nearly all his life. When Mungo's people first entered Australia, they probably carried atlatls. Mungo's ancestors came from Southeast Asia, suggesting many people in Europe and Asia were likely atlatling earlier than 50,000 years ago! When human hunters entered North America 15,000 years ago or so, they were probably armed with atlatls. Stone weapon points known as Clovis points were almost certainly used on atlatis beginning about 13,000 years ago. Furthermore, we have conclusive evidence that Clovis people succeeded in killing mammoths: Mammoth skeletons have been discovered with Clovis points embedded in their rib cages.",

Neanderthals hunted mammoth and piled their bones in great heaps \u2014 maybe even making cabins out of legs and shoulder blades.

The beasts would be driven through a funnel-shaped corral constructed from piles of rocks and thick branches woven into barricades. Hunters waving blankets urged the hairy beasts to stampede from the wide entrance into the narrow neck of the funnel until the herd plunged over a cliff. Thousand of years earlier, Ice Age hunters in Europe used cliff-traps to harvest the biggest and most dangerous game \u2014woolly rhinos and mammoths.

The world's largest find of Redbeds amphibians was made by bulldozer operator James Smajstrla of Baylor County, Texas. Smajstrla was excavating a water tank for cattle on the Craddock Ranch in Seymour, Texas, but first needed a detailed survey of the site. Dr. Robert Bakker, curator of vertebrate paleontology at HMNS, combed the outcrop for three days searching for fossils, but found none. There were no fossils on the surface, but when Smajstrla dug 10 feet he spotted some odd-looking rocks. At 12 feet, Smajstrla hit a layer of red rock jammed full of petrified heads, shoulders, and chests. The bones were so delicate that the crew had to soak them in super glue before they crumbled into dust. Museum curator David Temple led a team of volunteers who chipped out the 6-ton block.

Not much heavier than a big turkey, psittacosaurs used their long, strong hind claws to dig burrows where they curled up to escape unpleasant weather. Some psittacosaurs fossilized as entire cr\u00e8ches - groups of youngsters who had hatched together, huddled side by side. Sudden floods buried the babies in a thick blanket of mud. Head anatomy shows that adult male and female parrot dinosaurs had separate roles. Males had large horns sticking sideways out from below their eyes -armament probably used to scare away other males. Female skulls were smoother and smaller. Parrot dinosaurs had, for their size, the strongest bite force of any dinosaur herbivore. Tall, strong beaks and enlarged jaw muscles let the psittacosaurs cut though hard-shelled fruit and tough leaves. At first sight, psittacosaurs, with their long hind limbs and short front legs, seem quite different from gigantic quadrupedal dinosaurs like Triceratops. But if you look closely at the psittacosaur beak, you'll see a clue to its close relationship. Thanks to Tony and Gaynor Banham There's an extra beak bone at the front of the muzzle, an unusual development seen elsewhere in the big-horned dinosaurs. Digestion was assisted by gizzard stones, or gastroliths - hard pebbles swallowed by the dinosaurs and embedded in the muscular walls of the stomach. Psittacosaurs were picky about what stones they picked up and ingested. They chose the hardest pebbles that would serve best as grinding stones. When the stomach contracted, the stones crunched food items. Gizzard stones gave the psittacosaur a set of stone molars that operated after the teeth in its jaws had finished chewing. The use of stomach stones evolved across the archosaur family tree. Today, crocodiles and alligators have muscular gizzards packed with rocks, and so do many herbivorous birds. Several types of long-necked plant-eating dinosaurs used gizzard stones, as well.",

Both of these raptor-dinosaurs were smart, speedy kick-boxers. Their teeth were sharp, but too small to kill big prey. Instead, their main weapon was an enlarged claw mounted on the hind foot. The hind leg was by far the strongest part of the body-far stronger than the jaws. Most predatory dinosaurs had claws with a flat bottom-surface, like an eagle's claw. Flat-bottomed claws are good for penetrating prey bodies and holding on. Raptor claws, in contrast, had a knife-like bottom edge that could cut a long wound. Body design in raptor-dinosaurs made them three-dimensional fighters. The torso was short and compact, and the tail had special bone rods that made the entire tail flip sideways or upward when its muscles were contracted. Tail flipping provided balance when the raptor-dinosaur twisted and turned in mid air.",

Tyrannosaurus rex Lancian-Age rocks are full of bones, but tracks are a rare find. After a century of searching, fossil hunters had discovered only a few scattered footprints. Then in the 1980s, Wyoming rancher and sharp eyed dino-sleuth Leonard Zerbst discovered this trackway-the largest known assembly of tracks for the age. The Zerbst track site didn't record just one species; here was a dinosaur gathering place where at least eight animals crossed a bed of moist sand within hours of each other. The track-makers represented five different species from four different orders. It was like a Lancian truck stop. 1. A lumbering duck-billed dinosaur, a plant-eater, walked slowly on its thickly padded paws, leaving three-toed tracks. 2. Lancian speedsters, members of the ostrich-dino, or ornithomimid clan, made long strides over the sand. Their compact, narrow feet made distinctive three-digit imprints like those left by a modern-day rhea, a South American cousin of the ostrich. 3. Two super-rare oviraptors- perhaps a mated pair - walked side by side on their long, narrow toes. Unlike most other Lancian-Age dinosaurs, oviraptors had well developed inner toes that left clear imprints behind the three main toes. 4. Wading birds scooted by making tracks like the herons'. Several types of water birds had evolved by Lancian times. They resembled flamingos, herons and ducks in their foot shapes. 5. Giant three toed tracks with sharp claws could mean only one thing: Tyrannosaurus rex. Why were so many species attracted to this one spot? Perhaps there was a pool of fresh drinking water nearby.

The three skeletons here were all excavated from one edmontosaur bone bed, the Ruth Mason Quarry. Drowned Multitudes? What happened to preserve entire herds? The sediments these duck-bills are found in were once river sandbars. Perhaps a hurricane drowned the herd and piled up blankets of sand over the carcasses, or an epidemic killed thousands and then a spring flood buried the skeletons. Low Mowers All duck-bills were lowcroppers. Their backbone curved down at the shoulders, so the head was held close to the ground. With their wide, squared off beaks, edmontosaurs could crop low-growing vegetation like dinosaurian lawn-mowers. They pulverized leaves and branches with hundreds of curved molars packed in together in the rear of the mouth, like a carrot-grater. Each molar had one side coated in hard enamel. The rest of the tooth was softer dentine. As the entire chewing surface wore away, the enamel sides stuck up, making sharp edges. New crowns were growing in all the time. The Only Thumbless Dinosaurs Look closely at the forepaws. Duck-bills are the only thumbless dinosaurs. Scientists use this symbol for duck-billed dinosaurs. Can you decipher it?

Dozens of duck-billed dinosaurs have been preserved with impressions of the skin surface pressed into the layers of sand and silt around them. But those fossils are only impressions; the real skin tissue rolled away, leaving what we call a dermal fingerprint. Actual 3D fossil skin, with the tissue petrified, is almost completely unknown. Certainly no paleontologist ever hoped to find a Triceratops with its hide intact. That is until 1998, when Wyoming rancher Leonard Zerbst noticed a fossil horn sticking out of a hill. Zerbst called in his friends at the Black Hills Institute- experts in excavating big, delicate fossils. In 2002, the field crew dug a deep hole and discovered a Triceratops skull. At first Lane didn't seem to be a big deal - just another T'tops head. T'tops skulls litter the West, and hundreds have been excavated. But then someone looked up at the ceiling of the excavation. A strange pebbly texture covered the rock. Impressions of skin surrounded much of the skeleton. Lane possibly had the most complete set of T'tops skin impressions ever found, and the skin fextures were beautiful and surprising. On his flanks, Lane had big, circular scales with a circle of smaller scales all around the periphery. Under the throat were rectangular scales. Under the belly were Chex-style scales. Lane was hauled back to the lab in Hill City, South. Dakota and tregied with extra care. Then the second shoe dropped: There was more than just impressions. There were great swathes of petrified skin tissue several inches thick. Lane debunked everything we thought we know about how a live T'tops looked. Paleontologists had assumed that Triceratops and other horned dinosaurs were naked, with skin covered in thin scales. Lane said otherwise. The big, round scales on his flank were like mini-volcanoes in shape. At the conter of each one was a raised protuberance, which had a hole in the top that went deep into the skin. Clearly, when Lane was alive, something grew out of that hole. Something like a long, coarse bristle. Our Triceratops likely had hairlike or feather-like bristle, which fits exactly with a primitive early relative of Triceralops \u2014Psillacosaurus. Several of the Psittacosaurus fossils dug from the famous feathered dinosaur lakebeds of Liaoning Province in China had preserved skin. One extraordinary specimen, which you can see in the Early Crefaceous section, had a cluster of bristles growing oul of its tail. Other primitive herbivorous dinosaurs have showed up with bristle-feathers as well, so, we can conclude that bristliness was an old feature in the family tree. Why grow bristles? Maybe they served as body whiskers, which would have helped the T'tops run through the dense woods on dark nights. Maybe they were used in courtship dances. We don't know for sure yet.",

Ammonites made high marks in all categories. From the Devonian Period to the end of the Cretaceous, ammonites generated tens of thousands of species that invaded nearly every salt-water habitat in the world. Ammonites as Geological Time-Keepers Ammonite species came so fast and furiously that the average species only lasted a million years or less. This quick turnover means that ammonites are near-perfect paleo-clocks. Squiggle-Sutures Ammonites are close kin of cuttlefish, squid and octopus and distant kin of the Nautilus. Like nautiloids, ammonites had hard shells that usually curled up in a fight spiral. As they grew, ammonites and nautiloids sealed off old parts of the shell with internal walls called septa. Where nautiloids made simple partitions, ammonites inner shell walls were bent and folded. In advanced ammonites, each species had its own way of squiggling, giving us a quick method of identification. But these squiggles served a greater purpose. The ammonite's body, head and tentacles were connected to the inner shell wall by muscles, which could be strained when it grabbed prey or wrestled with another ammonite. A folded inner shell wall gave the muscles more surface area, allowing them to attach much more firmly. Boom and Bust and Boom and Bust Ammonites demonstrate a rhythm of success and failure over 300 million years-exploding in diverse new species, and then, tens of millions of years later, going totally bust. Most species would die out, and the few surviving species would proliferate again and then go bust once more. The final boom happened as T. rex and Triceratops ruled the land. Just as the last big dinosaurs died out, the ammonite hordes died, too. This time there were no survivors.",

In the oceans, all the ammonites died, although the less common nautiloids survived. Reefs were devastated. Plankton suffered near complete extinction. All the sea-lizards perished, as did the remaining plesiosaurs. Sea turtles, at least, survived. On land, all the big dinosaurs died out. But the bird branch of the dinosaurian family tree continued to evolve and, in the Post-Cretaceous world, expand. What caused this catastrophe? Many scientists are convinced that a massive meteorite smashed into the globe, sending up a cloud of debris that darkened the skies and chilled the Earth's surface so thoroughly that forests and woodlands were wiped out, depriving herbivorous dinosaurs of food and, in turn, depriving the carnivores of prey. Plus, acid rain may have fallen, deluging habitals in land and sea. A meleorite does seem to have struck at or near the time of the great extinction, but would global cooling and THE LATE CRETACEOUS WORLD acid rain produce the pattern of death we see in the fossil record? The survivors help us test the extinction theories, In freshwater lakes and rivers, crocodiles, alligators, turtles, frogs and salamanders survived. A profound chilling, along with acid rain, would have killed many of these cold-blooded reptiles and amphibians. On dry land, many lizards, snakes and mammals also survived and continued to evolve, even though small animals are unable to withstand cooling as well as giant species can. What would kill big dinosaurs but leave crocodiles, turtles, small amphibians and mammals? An old theory says that extinctions are often caused by the sudden invasion of foreign species, which become pests in their new lands and introduce all sorts of new diseases. Big dinosaurs could certainly travel farther and faster than aquatic crocodilians, amphibians or small Cretaceous mammals. Perhaps the big dinosaurs were victims of their own big-ness.

The armor-plated garfish is a classic living fossil -a creature alive today that has changed little from the time of the tyrannosaurs, 90 million years ago. The alligator gar has diamond-shaped, armor-plated scales-each one made from a double layer of bone. The outer layer is super-dense and so hard that even big bull alligators have a hard time biting through it. The inner layer is spongier and attached to a sheet of connective tissue that works like a shock absorber. All the scales are knit together with tongue in-groove joints, allowing the fish to twist and flex. Gars seem to be bulletproof from extinction, too. Mass die-offs struck dinosaurs 65 million years ago and then struck giant mammals several times. But each catastrophe left the gars unscathed. Afractosteus was the apex predator in the sluggish fivers of the Green River time, ambushing other fish, baby gators, snakes and the occasional 'possum. This specimen shows the tough, double-layered armored scales at we also see in modern alligator gars.

Gar-Type Scales Are Ancient In the Devonian, many fish tribes, both fresh-water and salt-water, had thick garlike scales. In the long run, fish evolution discriminated against thick armor, favoring thinner and lighter scales. By Green River times natural selection had eliminated most of the bulletproof fishes, except for the gars. Why did gars retain the old-fashioned armor? We don't know for sure. Today's gars are lurkers, hiding in the shadows until prey swims near. The thick, heavy armor works ne for such tactics. However, for most fish, thinner scales and greater flexibility provide faster speeds and greater endurance. Another ancient feature gars kept was air-breathing.
